&lWelcome to Alpha 1.0.2!&r

In the last release I noticed that
there were enchants that were too
overpowered. These enchants got removed.
I also undid the fact that resource packs
got enabled by default.
There are still other things to be worked
on: quests, balancing mods, custom data packs,
etc...

&lWhat has changed?&r

&l-&r Updated all mods to the latest version.
&l-&r Removed some &lenchants&r for being too
      overpowered.
&l-&r Removed &lresource packs&r from being
      applied automatically.
&l-&r Added some &lnew biomes&r above &oand
      under&r the ground in the overworld!
&l-&r Added &lstructures&r to the &oNether&r
      and &oThe End&r.
&l-&r Added more &lfoods and meals&r, enjoy
      the popcorn!
&l-&r Added more &lmobs&r! Watch out for the
      Frozen Zombies or the &oforgotten species&!
&l-&r Fixed some bugs!
