**Welcome to Alpha 1.0.2!**

In the last release I noticed that there were enchants that were too overpowered. These enchants got removed.
I also undid the fact that resource packs got enabled by default.
There are still other things to be worked on: quests, balancing mods, custom data packs,etc...

**What has changed?**

- Updated all the mods to latest version.
- Removed some **enchants** for being too overpowered.
- Removed **resource packs** from being automatically applied when joining.
- Added some **new biomes** above *and under* the ground to the overworld!
- Added some **structures** to the *Nether* and *The End*.
- Added more **foods and meals** to the modpack, enjoy the popcorn!
- Added more **mobs**! Watch out for the frozen Zombies or the *forgotten species*!
- Fixed some bugs with the custom menu's.
