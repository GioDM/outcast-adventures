# Welcome to Alpha 1.0.2!

In the last release I noticed that there were enchants that were too overpowered for this modpack. These enchants got removed. There were also complains about resource pack being default and non-removable. These resource packs are not default anymore and can be applied when you feel like it.
There are still things to be worked on: quests, balancing mods, making custom datapacks, etc.


# What has changed?

- Updated all the mods to latest version.
- Removed some **enchants** for being too overpowered.

- Added more **foods and meals** to the modpack, enjoy the popcorn!
- Added more **mobs**! Watch out for the frozen Zombies or the *forgotten species*!
